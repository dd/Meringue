Thanks for downloading Meringue.

To install it, make sure you have Python 3.6 or later. Then run this command from the
command prompt:

    python setup.py install

If you're upgrading from a previous version, you need to remove it first.

AS AN ALTERNATIVE, you can just copy the entire "meringue" directory to Python's
site-packages directory, which is located wherever your Python installation
lives. Some places you might check are:

    /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages (Unix, Python 3.6)
    C:\\PYTHON\\site-packages        (Windows)

For more detailed instructions, see docs/intro/install.txt.
